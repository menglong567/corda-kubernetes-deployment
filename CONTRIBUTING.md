# Contributing to the Corda Kubernetes Deployment

The Corda Kubernetes Deployment is an open-source project and contributions are welcome.

Please note that any changes will have to be of high-quality and be well documented.

The contributors are listed in this document: [Contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md)

## Branch naming

Fixes should be named fix/<short description of issue>, for example fix/container_registry_connection_issue.

Larger pieces of work that are expected to be in progress for some time should be named wip/<description of changes>, for example wip/aws_support.
WIP stands for Work In Progress.

Huge new features can be named feat/<description of feature>, for example feat/<add HSM support>.
The idea is that just by looking at the branch name we can estimate the size of the changes contained within that branch.

All new changes should be added from custom branches that are merged to master by way of a pull request.
