For now, the documentation contained here is limited to new topics that have not been added to the main documentation site yet.

## TOPICS

### Cost calculation of Kubernetes deployment versus a traditional bare-metal deployment

We have received many requests to compare the cost of deploying using Kubernetes versus a traditional bare-metal based installation.

Although the answer will be dependent on the use-case specific details, for example are we talking about high-frequency trading with high number of transactions per second or 
are we talking about high quality asset issuance which occurs much less frequently, we can still generate some rough estimates that hopefully will be useful as indications.

The details can be found in this dedicated document: 
[Cost calculation & comparison](COST_CALCULATION.md)
